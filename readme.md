# Liquid Democracy Experiment

This is a personal open-sourced project to learn the use of the Laravel framework

The project is a web application to create and manage any kind of community using a [Delegative Democracy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Delegative_democracy) system.

Delegative democracy, also known as liquid democracy, is a form of democratic control whereby an electorate vests voting power in delegates rather than in representatives.
