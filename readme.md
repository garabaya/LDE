# Liquid Democracy Experiment

This is a personal open-sourced project to learn the use of the Laravel framework

The project is a web application to create and manage any kind of community using a [Delegative Democracy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Delegative_democracy) system.

Delegative democracy, also known as liquid democracy, is a form of democratic control whereby an electorate vests voting power in delegates rather than in representatives.

As you can see the entity named 'Community' is the core of the entire Database diagram, even wrapping the 'User' entity in a single membership community that inherits all his capabilities. This allows a user to belong to several independent communities.
